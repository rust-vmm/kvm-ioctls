## Changed

  with the KVM API

## Fixed
- Fix bug in KvmRunWrapper. The memory for kvm_run struct was not unmapped

# v0.1.0

First release of the kvm-ioctls crate.

The kvm-ioctls crate provides safe wrappers over the KVM API, a set of ioctls
used for creating and configuring Virtual Machines (VMs) on Linux.
The ioctls are accessible through four structures:
- Kvm - wrappers over system ioctls
- VmFd - wrappers over VM ioctls
- VcpuFd - wrappers over vCPU ioctls
- DeviceFd - wrappers over device ioctls

The kvm-ioctls can be used on x86_64 and aarch64. Right now the aarch64
support is considered experimental.
